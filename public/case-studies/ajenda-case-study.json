	"project": "Ajenda",
	"title": "Streamlining Task Management and Scheduling",
	"challenge": "Existing to-do list and scheduling apps lacked the combined functionality I needed. Managing my tasks across multiple tools was inefficient and frustrating.",
	"role": "Full-Stack Developer (UI/UX Design & Implementation)",
	"tech": ["React", "Firebase", "Firestore", "MUI"],
	"features": [
		"Integrated Brainstorming & Prioritization:  Intuitive to-do list creation with seamless drag-and-drop sorting for easy prioritization.",
		"Flexible Scheduling: Schedule tasks with precise start and end times or set all-day events. 'Past Due' reminders promote accountability.",
		"Organized Task Management:  Tasks are automatically categorized ('Past Due', 'Unscheduled,' 'Scheduled,' 'Completed') for streamlined workflow and progress tracking."
	],
	"result": "As my first React project, Ajenda challenged me across multiple areas of web development, from front-end logic to back-end integration. Overcoming these hurdles significantly deepened my understanding of full-stack development and the value of persistence in the face of complex projects.  Through dedicated research and iteration, I aimed to create a user-friendly and intuitive experience. Ajenda now serves as a powerful portfolio piece, demonstrating my ability to learn new technologies quickly and translate ideas into functional web applications."
